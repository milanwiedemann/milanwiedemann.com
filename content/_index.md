I'm a PhD student at the [Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-centre-for-anxiety-disorders-and-trauma) at the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford.

I'm using this website to document my R learning process and to share some information about myself and my work.
