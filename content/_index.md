Hi, I'm Milan Wiedemann, a second-year PhD student at the [Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-centre-for-anxiety-disorders-and-trauma) (OxCADAT) at the [Department of Experimental Psychology](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford.

This Hugo theme was ported from [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy), a minimalist website generator built in Python. I don't have time to document it. You have to read the source code to understand what it can do. Like Ivy, this theme is also released under [the Unlicense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense), which basically means you just do whatever you want.

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/).
