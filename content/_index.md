I'm a PhD student at the [Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-centre-for-anxiety-disorders-and-trauma) at the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford.
My main interest is evidence-based health care, particularly in clinical psychology.
At the moment I'm trying to understand more about the processes through which cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder works.
You can find out more about my projects [here](/research).

I `:heart:` using R for my work and will use this website to blog about my R learning process and some projects I'm working on.
