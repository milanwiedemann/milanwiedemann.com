I'm a PhD candidate at the Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma ([OxCADAT](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-centre-for-anxiety-disorders-and-trauma)) at the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford.
My main research interest is evidence-based health care, particularly in clinical psychology.
How do we know what works and what doesnâ€™t work and why does it work?
At the moment I'm trying to understand more about the processes through which cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder works.
In addition to my research interests I'm enjoying to learn about applied statistics and :purple_heart: to create open-source software tools that help to visualise and analyse data.
