I'm a data scientist working for the [Clinical Development Unit](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/about.html) at the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.
I enjoy working on [software tools](/software) that help to visualise and analyse data.
My main research interest is evidence-based health care, particularly in clinical psychology.
How do we know what works and what doesn't work? 
Why does it work?
