I'm a quantitative researcher with experience in evaluating psychological interventions and analysing routinely collected NHS patient data.
Currently I'm working as a data scientist for the [Clinical Development Unit](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/about.html) at the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.
I explore how we can improve clinical care by analysing routinely collected clinical outcomes and patient experiences.

I enjoy working on [software tools](/software) that help to tidy, visualise, and analyse large datasets.
My main research interest is evidence-based health care, particularly in clinical psychology.
How do we know what works and what doesn't work? 
Why does it work?
