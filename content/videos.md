I like filming and editing videos in my free time and also work as a part time research assistant for the [Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-centre-for-anxiety-disorders-and-trauma).
I've created videos that are embedded in a newly developed internet program for treating PTSD and videos to train therapists in delivering this treatment.
