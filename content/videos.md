I like filming and editing videos for fun and also work as a part time research assistant for the [Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-centre-for-anxiety-disorders-and-trauma).
I've created videos that are embedded in a newly developed internet program for treating PTSD and videos to train therapists in delivering this treatment.

# Videos for online treatments

I've mainly worked on creating videos for a newly developed online therapy for PTSD.
A pilot paper desrcibing the treatment is available [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3402/ejpt.v7.31019?needAccess=true#). 
Below is a short video giving an overview of the internet program.

# Videos for training therapists

I was involved in filming and editing videos to help therapists treat clients using specialised cognitive therapies for Social Anxiety Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
To see the videos and other resources go to the [OxCADAT Resources](https://oxcadatresources.com/) website.

# Workshops

Here is a video from the [Changing Lives](https://www.torch.ox.ac.uk/event/changing-lives-0) workshop that I created for the [The Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities Humanities Divison (TORCH)](https://www.torch.ox.ac.uk/).
