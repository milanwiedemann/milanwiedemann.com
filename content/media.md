I work as a part-time research assistant for the Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma ([OxCADAT](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-centre-for-anxiety-disorders-and-trauma)) to create videos for online therapies. 
I also enjoy filming and editing videos to share my research or other exciting projects.

### Video abstracts

My colleague [Urška Košir](https://twitter.com/UrskaKosir) and I recently reviewed the literature to find out why some adolescent cancer survivors have a harder time adapting to life after illness, see [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cnr2.1168).
We filmed a short video summarising our findings, see our video below :movie_camera:

### Videos for psychological online treatments

I've mainly worked on creating videos for a newly developed online therapy for PTSD.
A pilot paper desrcibing the treatment is available [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3402/ejpt.v7.31019?needAccess=true#). 
Below is a short video giving an overview of the internet program.

### Videos for training psychological therapists

I'm also involved in filming and editing videos to help therapists treat clients using specialised cognitive therapies for Social Anxiety Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

### Videos for charities

Below is an example video I filmed for [The Loss Foundation](https://www.thelossfoundation.org/) on coping with grief.
We also filmed videos on [What is Anxiety and How to Manage it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibpaKdrQY_o), [Understanding Depression and How to Manage it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63kAOJT-DA8&feature=emb_title), [Understanding Flashbacks and Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=YNsPABfXlGQ&feature=emb_logo), and [How to Manage Sleep Difficulties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q80iusC9x4&feature=emb_title).
All animations in these videos were created by [Robin Whitten](http://robinwhitten.co.uk/).
