I'm interested in the mechanisms of therapeutic change and recovery in psychological therapies for mental health problems.

My project aims to investigate the mechanisms of treatment effects in cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. 
To investigate how the treatment works, the project will closely monitor changes in variables that are thought to drive symptom change according to cognitive theories of PTSD, as well as changes in symptom severity and the therapeutic relationship. 
This will allow me to study in detail which components of the treatment are linked to substantial improvement.

I'm also working as a research assistant creating videos for a newly developed internet program for treating PTSD as well as training therapists in deliving the treatment.
