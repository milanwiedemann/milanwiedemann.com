<h2>Psychological treatment research</h2>
<p>I’m interested in the processes of change in evidence-based psychological therapies for mental health problems.
In my PhD I’m taking a closer look at at how cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder works.
To learn more about this I analyse changes in variables that are thought to drive symptom change according to cognitive theories of PTSD.
My two main projects are looking at <strong>sudden gains</strong> and <strong>mediation of clinical improvement</strong> during treatment.</p>
<p>During the course of my PhD I started to feel the superpowers of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> :rocket: and have created some tools that make my life a bit easier, see <a href="/software">here</a>.
The code for all of my software projects is available on <a href="https://github.com/milanwiedemann">GitHub</a>.</p>
