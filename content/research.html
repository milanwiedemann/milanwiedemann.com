<h2>Psychological treatment research</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m interested in processes of change in evidence-based psychological therapies for mental health problems.
To learn more about how psychological therapies may work I look how changes in theory-derived psychological processes are associated with changes in clinical symptoms.
Iâ€™m developing tools that implement some clinical research methodologies in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> ðŸš€ to help users to understand how these methods work, see a short summary <a href="/software">here</a>.
The code for all of my software projects is available on <a href="https://github.com/milanwiedemann">GitHub</a>.</p>
