<h2>Psychological treatment research</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m interested in the processes of change in evidence-based psychological therapies for mental health problems.
In my PhD Iâ€™m taking a closer look at at how cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder works.
To learn more about this I analyse changes in variables that are thought to drive symptom change according to cognitive theories of PTSD.
My two main projects are looking at longitudinal changes during therapy to better understand:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Sudden symptom improvements</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Associations between changes in symptoms and cognitive factors</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>During the course of my PhD I started to feel the superpowers of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> ðŸš€ and have created some tools that make my life a bit easier, see a short summary <a href="/software">here</a>.
The code for all of my software projects is available on <a href="https://github.com/milanwiedemann">GitHub</a>.</p>
