<p>I work as a part-time research assistant for the Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma (<a href="https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-centre-for-anxiety-disorders-and-trauma">OxCADAT</a>) to create videos for online therapies.
I also enjoy filming and editing videos to share my research or other exciting projects.</p>

<p>My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/UrskaKosir">Urška Košir</a> and I systematically reviewed the literature to find out why some adolescent cancer survivors have a harder time adapting to life after illness, see <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cnr2.1168">here</a>.
We filmed a short video summarising our findings, see our video below :movie_camera:</p>

<h2>And more …</h2>
<p>I have worked with <strong><a href="https://www.thelossfoundation.org/">The Loss Foundation</a></strong> to create videos illustrating some difficulties that people who lost someone close might experience and suggestions on how to deal with it.
All animations in these videos were created by <a href="http://robinwhitten.co.uk/">Robin Whitten</a>.
Links to all videos can be found <a href="https://www.thelossfoundation.org/services/understanding-bereavement/">here</a>, for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K0xarOS6iA&amp;feature=emb_title">Understanding Bereavement</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=YNsPABfXlGQ&amp;feature=emb_logo">Understanding Flashbacks and Nightmares</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the video I created for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgIbg_qu4m4&amp;feature=emb_title">Changing Lives</a> workshop where experts from different fields discussed how children growing up in adversity can thrive in Britain.
