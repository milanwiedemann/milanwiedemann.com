## Psychological treatment research

I'm interested in processes of change in evidence-based psychological therapies for mental health problems.
To learn more about how psychological therapies may work I look how changes in theory-derived psychological processes are associated with changes in clinical symptoms. 
I'm developing tools that implement some clinical research methodologies in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) `r emo::ji("rocket")` to help users to understand how these methods work, see a short summary [here](/software).
The code for all of my software projects is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/milanwiedemann).

<!-- What data may be useful to learn how the service can be improved? -->

<!-- At the CDU NOTTSHC we are  -->

<!-- What can we learn about inequalities,  -->
