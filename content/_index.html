<p>Iâ€™m a data scientist working for the <a href="https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/about.html">Clinical Development Unit</a> at the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.
I enjoy working on <a href="/software">software tools</a> that help to visualise and analyse data.
My main research interest is evidence-based health care, particularly in clinical psychology.
How do we know what works and what doesnâ€™t work?
Why does it work?</p>
