<p>Iâ€™m a quantitative researcher with experience in evaluating psychological interventions and routinely collected NHS patient data.
Currently Iâ€™m working as a data scientist for the <a href="https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/about.html">Clinical Development Unit</a> at the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.
I explore how we can improve clinical care by analysing routinely collected clinical outcomes and patient experiences.</p>
<p>I enjoy working on <a href="/software">software tools</a> that help to tidy, analyse, and visualise large datasets.
My main research interest is evidence-based health care, particularly in clinical psychology.
How do we know what works and what doesnâ€™t work?
Why does it work?</p>
