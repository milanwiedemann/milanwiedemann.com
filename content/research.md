## Psychological treatment research

I'm interested in the processes of change in evidence-based psychological therapies for mental health problems.
In my PhD I'm taking a closer look at at how cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder works. 
To learn more about this I analyse changes in variables that are thought to drive symptom change according to cognitive theories of PTSD.
My two main projects are looking at **sudden gains** and **mediation of clinical improvement** during treatment.
During the course of my PhD I started to feel the superpowers of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) :rocket: and have created some tools that make my life a bit easier, see [here](/software).
The code for all of my software projects is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/milanwiedemann).
