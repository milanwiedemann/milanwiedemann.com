I'm interested in the processes of therapeutic change and recovery in evidence-based psychological therapies for mental health problems.

In my PhD I'm looking at processes of treatment effects in cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. 
To investigate how the treatment works, I analyse changes in variables that are thought to drive symptom change according to cognitive theories of PTSD.
Below is a list of some projets I'm working on. 

## Projects

### Sudden gains

Sudden gains are clinically meaningful symptom improvements experienced by patients from one session to the next. While the positive effect of sudden gains on treatment outcomes is well established, less is known about the processes involved in their occurrence and why they are linked to better treatment outcomes. Learning more about the processes associated with sudden gains might help us to answer these questions and better understand how therapy works.

### Mediation of clinical improvement

The processes by which cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder works are still not well understood. 
Examining mediation of clinical improvement might help to understand these processes.
The focus of mediation analysis is the estimation of the indirect effect (a * b) of change in PTSD symptoms during treatment through an intermediary mediator variable (e.g. negative cognitions) at the previous time-point. 
Investigating mediation effects helps to test whether the treatment works for the reasons suggested by the underpinning cognitive model.
