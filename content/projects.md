I'm interested in the processes of change in evidence-based psychological therapies for mental health problems.

In my PhD I'm looking at processes of treatment effects in cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. 
To investigate how the treatment works I analyse changes in variables that are thought to drive symptom change according to cognitive theories of PTSD.

During the course of my PhD I started to feel the superpowers of R Studio `:heart:` and started using it for all my research related work.
As a results I've designed R packages to make my life a bit easier.

## R Packages

### *suddengains*

My colleagues [Graham Thew](https://twitter.com/drgrahamthew) and [Richard Stott](https://twitter.com/DrRichardStott) and supervisor [Anke Ehlers](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/anke-ehlers) and I designed this package to make the research of sudden gains as easy and reproducible as possible. Below you see an illustration of how to use the package to identify sudden gains and create a plot from scratch in real time. We describe more background info and why we think this package might be useful in our preprint on [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/2wa84/). You can check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/milanwiedemann/suddengains).

### *lcsm*

While learning about latent change score models for one of my research projects I was quite confused initally.
Trying to understand how to write lavaan code for these models I made quite some copy and paste errors and as a result got so annoyed that I decided to let R write all the lavaan syntax for these models. See my ideas and code on [GitHub](https://github.com/milanwiedemann/lcsm).

### *txanimate*

Recently I got inspired by the R package [gganimate](https://gganimat) and started thinking about ways to animate change processes during treatments. Check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/milanwiedemann/txanimate).
