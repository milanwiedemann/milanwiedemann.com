Generally I'm interested in the mechanisms of therapeutic change and recovery in evidence-based psychological therapies for mental health problems.

In my PhD I'm looking at mechanisms of treatment effects in cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. 
To investigate how the treatment works, I monitor changes in variables that are thought to drive symptom change according to cognitive theories of PTSD, as well as changes in symptom severity and the therapeutic relationship. 
This will allow me to study in detail which components of the treatment are linked to substantial clinical improvement.

I'm also working as a research assistant creating videos for a newly developed internet program for treating PTSD. 
Another video project I'm invoved in aims to train clinical therapists in delivering the cognitive therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
