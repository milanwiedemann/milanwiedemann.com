I'm interested in the processes of therapeutic change and recovery in evidence-based psychological therapies for mental health problems.

In my PhD I'm looking at processes of treatment effects in cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. 
To investigate how the treatment works, I analyse changes in variables that are thought to drive symptom change according to cognitive theories of PTSD.
Below is a list of some projects I'm working on.
